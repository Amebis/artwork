We use the flag files on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallery_of_sovereign_state_flags). These files have the following license:

`This work has been released into the public domain by its author. This applies worldwide. In some countries this may not be legally possible; if so: [author] grants anyone the right to use this work for any purpose, without any conditions, unless such conditions are required by law.`

The default flag files have been made smaller by 60% to they consume less bandwidth when downloaded by the eduVPN client. The full pictures are also available.
