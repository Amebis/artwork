# Introduction
All artwork for the eduVPN project is located in this repository.

# Guidelines
* All artwork is situated in the relevant directory/categories. E.g. icons are located in the icon directory and logos are located in the logo directory.
* All UI artwork starts with the groupname. E.g. **icon**_connect.png and **logo**_surfnet.png.
* File names won't be changed after they are final. Otherwise applications that rely on these artwork can brake.
* If multiple files of one piece of artwork exist, the default option is as short as possible. For example, the default flags are named 'flag_country.png', but the larger versions of those files are named 'flag_country_full.png'.
