## General impression
![Overview styling version 3](overview.png)

## Use cases
The styling is intended for all eduVPN applications. Currently this means the eduVPN for Windows and eduVPN for Android clients. We are also working on MacOS, iOS and Linux. Additionally to eduVPN, this styling will also be used for the Let's Connect! apps.

## Behaviour
* On first use, the user is presented the 'Select your VPN type' screen. 
* When at least one profile has been previously added, the user will see the 'Connect' screen where he/she can connect to the previously added profile or add another (new profile) to the list.
* When the user already has Secure Internet profiles loaded, the 'Select your profile' screen will only show the 'Institute Access' and 'Add another address' buttons as shown in `0-select-profile-access-only.png`.

# Guidelines
## Windows
* The font used is Segoe UI.

## Android
* The font used is Open Sans.

## Logo and banner
* The font used is SURFnet's Gotham Rounded.

This page will be elaborated at a later point. For more information about the styling, please look at the Styling version 2 [requirements document](https://github.com/eduvpn/documentation/tree/master/app/windows).
